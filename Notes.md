Integrate psychonic's plugin
======================
 - Wait until the server enters hibernation to start configuring
 - Set a rcon password. Have the server connect and set up the player list.
 - Once the server is configured give the players the IP address.
 - Track when players connect and change their screen

 New Connect UI
 =====================
 - New UI for when searching for a match (nice progress bar?)
 - Maybe publish lobby queue count?
 - Add another state, configuring server.
 

 Bugs
 ===================
 Fix weird bug with switching lobbies
 Refreshing page on lobby screws things up
 Fucking shitty layout when browser window is small
